2. Extract the `Mods` and `UserData` folders of the ZIP file into your game's directory.
3. Launch the game, and the mod will automatically initialize after joining your first game.


## Configuration
- The mod generates a configuration file (`MoreRealisticLaundering.json`) in the `UserData` folder.
