## Summary

MoreRealisticLaundering enhances the in-game money laundering mechanics by introducing more detailed customization and management options for businesses.

## Known Incompatiblities / Issues
- Not compatible with most translation mods
- Not compatible with most mods that modify the Deliveries App
- Custom app takes long to be visible: Allows other mods to load their custom apps before


## What's new in Version 1.1.2?
- Enhanced the `Legit Mode` that you can only access via the configuration file `MoreRealisticLaundering.json`.
- Legit Mode will allow you to use the config file only, without any ingame UI (Mobile App).
- This aims for players that do not want the seduction of tweaking the settings like cheats in real time but want to use the general features for their playstyle.
- To enable the Legit Mode, set the `Use_Legit_Version` variable to `true` (default is false, which will create the "Tax & Wash" app as usual).


## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/user/MoreRealisticLaundering/releases) page.
2. Extract the `Mods` and `UserData` folders of the ZIP file into your game's directory.
3. Launch the game, and the mod will automatically initialize.


## Configuration
- The mod generates a configuration file (`MoreRealisticLaundering.json`) in the `UserData` folder.
- You can edit this file to customize the default settings for each business however this is optional
- Use the custom app ingame to modify everything dynamically
